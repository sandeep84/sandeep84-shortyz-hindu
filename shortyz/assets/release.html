<h2>Shortz 3.2.1</h2>

<p>This release is mostly just cleanup for Google TV and JellyBean devices. If this doesn't affect you, you can ignore it.</p>
<p>Google TV is hiding the ActionBar properly again. The Nexus 7 now uses the Google TV landscape view and the ICS 10" screen
portrait view. All the downloader bugs in JB have been fixed.</p>

<h3>Previously 3.1.5</h3>

<p>First, there is a new option on the settings screen to suppress marking hinted squares on the playboard!</p>

<p>Some bug fixes in this release, and updated to support GoogleTV.</p>


<h3>Previously: 3.1.2</h3>

<p>First, I have fixed some crash bugs that many of you have contacted me about. Thanks.</p>

<p>Secondly, some of you have emailed me about the "Cheated" boxes. Some of you seem to have
taken personal offense at the implication that you are "cheaters". To that end, I have changed the
word "cheated" to "hinted". As to the nature of the change, let me explain...</p>

<p>Lots of you play with the "Show Errors" feature on. This highlights your incorrect boxes as
you fill in the puzzle. With the new change, boxes that have been highlighted as being in error
are marked as red on the screen. Lots of people like to play this way as it makes the puzzles more
approachable and can turn a puzzle that might take you an hour into something you can do on a 20 minute
train ride. Previously, boxes were only marked as "Cheated" (with the pink indicator) if you used
the "Reveal" function (and then the word cheated was what I called it internally, and was never 
presented to the user). However, to have an Apples to Apples scoring system for the "Share" option
(and some future features) it is necessary to take into account that having "Show Errors" reveal an 
error is, functionally, the same as having the answer given to you, as you could just key every letter
into the box until it showed as "Correct".</p>

<p>If you don't care about the "show errors" lights, just keep playing as you have. The only difference
in your play will be some slight pink hues behind letters you have corrected. If you do want to work
on your solve time, <b>Press Menu -> Hide Errors</b> you can still make typos, change your answers, 
whatever you want, and none of your overplays will not be counted as "hints".</p>


<h3>Previously: 3.1.0</h3>

<p>First, sorry to everyone who has emailed me recently. My life has been crazy and I have not been as good as I should
about getting back to Shortyz users. I promise it will get better soon. :P</p>

<p>Anyway, this version adds good support for Ice Cream Sandwich for y'all, who like me, are chomping at the bit to
get your hands on the Galaxy Nexus. There is also a new Puzzle Completion dialog that includes the option to
share your information on via your social networking clients, email, etc. Also a fix so that broken
puzzle URLs like the People puzzle from this week (they messed up on their end) don't linger around. Also,
boxes that you have flagged with "Show Errors" now show as "Cheated" persistently.</p>


<h3>Previously: 3.0.7</h3>

<p>Quick changes to adapt to the NYTimes changing their site and changing the source of the LATimes crossword puzzle.</p>


<h3>Previously: 3.0.4</h3>

<p>Quick update: Sorry about the People Magazine problems. They don't publish their
answers electronically. The app will no longer show you the incorrect values.</p>

<p>New Puzzles! People Magazine and Victor Fleming's "I Swear" puzzles have been
added to the downloaders. Also the WaPo overwriting issue is corrected.</p>



<h3>Previously: 3.0.3</h3>

<p>As some of you long-time users will remember, at the request of LitSoft, the people who provided crossword software to
CrosSynergy (The syndicators of the Washington Post/Houston Chronicle puzzle) requested that those puzzles be removed from
the application a while ago. I included a link in the release notes where those puzzles could be downloaded for free 
from the chron.com web site. Well, CrosSynergy is no longer using LitSoft software to publish there puzzles, and I, therefore,
no longer feel LitSoft has standing to request that those puzzles are excluded. Thanks to some new code from Jeff Davidson supporting
the .JPZ puzzle format... <b>The Washington Post Daily Puzzle</b> is now supported again.
</p>

<p> Other news in this release.
<ul>
	<li>Fixed support for (I hope) Android 3.1. Seems this is being tested on
	Xooms right now.</li>
	<li><b>I don't know how well Shortyz is going to play on the 2.3.4 release announced yesterday, but Nexus users,
	I promise I will get it updated ASAP if there are problems</b></li>
	<li>Added a timeout trap of 150ms on non-character hardware keys for the 
	Moto Droid 2's with picky keyboards</li>
	<li>A number of small crash fixes</li>
	<li>Corrected (hopefully) style issues in the HTMLView</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Briefly, some things that are on-deck but not ready for release: Support for .jpz direct download and file access
for JPZ files. This is the new standard for Crossword Compiler and a number of indy puzzles. 
I hope that over the next few months this will let me support the Brit/Aussie puzzles
everyone has been asking for -- presuming they upgrade from the old CCJ format to JPZ.</p>

<h3>Previously: 3.0.1</h3>

<p>First... <b>Shortyz in the News!</b></p>

<p>In the lead up to the holidays, Shortyz got some nice press. It was listed on 
<a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/12/24/fifteen-fun-android-games.aspx"><i>Game
Informer's</i> first list of Android games</a>, and was also mentioned in the <i>New York Times</i> as
a "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/technology/personaltech/23smart.html?_r=1">
Top Picks for Apps to Help You While Away the Minutes</a>". As I have stated before, this is either a)
a "scratch your own itch" Open Source project or b) a labor of love, depending on your preferred 
terminology, so this kind of recognition is really gratifying. But mostly, you guys rock. </p>

<p>As I noted many moons ago, the Shortyz user base has really been great. I have only gotten one
nasty email, well, and the <a href="http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/7775">Litsoft affair</a>.
As always, feel free to email me with anything you want. I can't make categorical promises, but I 
do read all email.</p>

<p>Shortyz 3 now has new support for Android 3.0 Honeycomb! There are new screen layouts for large screens
(Gingerbread tablets should see these too!) and it now takes full advantage of the new Action Bar.</p>

<p> Other changes:
<ul> 
	<li>There is now an option to lock the orientation of the app in the preferences screen.</li>
	<li>Some work has been done to prevent puzzle corruption if you exit the app suddenly</li>
	<li>For Android 3.0 or higher, most puzzles now download using the Android "Download Manager." 
		I am going to need to spend some time to make this work for 2.3.X users.</li>
	<li>For 3.0.1: A small fix for people with older phones to prevent a crash</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.3.12</h3>

<p>Just a quick fix to correct the problems with the new LAT site settings. Thanks to everyone 
who reported this. As always, if you are having problems, please email.</p>

<h3>Previosly: 2.3.11</h3>

<p>2.3.<b>11</b> on 11/11. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7IZZXQ89Oc">Happy Nigel Tufner Day</a>!</p>

<p> This is just a quick fix for the NYT support. It will now give you a popup message if your password is 
incorrect (something I should have done ages ago). There was also a bug where if you entered an incorrect password,
and tried to download using the download dialog, and not the regular scheduled download, it wouldn't register
your updated credentials.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Michael Nash for helping me run this one down.</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.3.10</h3>

<p>Another sad one, but Brendan Emmet Quigley has asked that his puzzles be removed from the auto download feature since he has made an agreement with Standalone.</p>

<p>As far as I know, his puzzles will still be available for free from <a href="http://www.brendanemmettquigley.com/">his blog.</a> Since this looks to become a 
recurring theme, both his blog and <a href="http://www.chron.com/apps/games/xword/puzzles/">this page where you can get the Houston Chronicle/CrosSynergy/Washinton Post</a>
are good pages to bookmark. I have added support for clicking puzzle links out of the browser to this version, so you may want to bookmark those pages.</p>

<p>Why, you may ask, is clicking on them out of the browser different than Shortyz downloading them on its own? That, my friend, is a good question. But as I have said before,
this is a hobby, I am not rich, and I don't want to pick a fight with anyone.</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.3.9</h3>

<p>This update has nothing for most of you. Sorry. If you play the NYTimes puzzle, or you are using a generic Chinese made
Android Tablet, you might care.</p>

<p>Many of you have noticed the NYTimes puzzles aren't updating. What happened is the NYT seems to have changed their policy on this
and the FIRST download of an NYT puzzle will contain the correct answer key, so the update logic is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>If you have a puzzle that "isn't updating", long press on it in the list screen and select "Mark as Updated", and you will see the new key.</p>

<p>If you have a Brand-X Android tablet, and you aren't getting a keyboard popup, there is now a pref to force the keyboard onto the screen, no
matter what the OS says about keyboard availability.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.3.8</h3>

<p>Quick update. This will fix this weeks Onion AV Club puzzle, but you will need to delete
and re download the puzzle. Also fixed a bug with the timer and the clues list screen.</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.3.7</h3>

<p>It is a sad day, but <a href="http://www.litsoft.com">Litsoft</a>, who, as I understand it, does online distribution 
for CrossSynergy (the provider of the Houston Chronicle puzzle available in Shortyz) has requested that I remove the 
puzzle from the list of puzzles that are downloaded.</p>

<p>It is my personal position that Shortyz does not violate any copyrights of anyone, since I do not copy, store, or 
duplicate any puzzles, but simply provide you, the user, with a means do directly download the puzzles onto your phone.
However, because I do not wish to bring any litigation down on myself for a hobby project, I have complied.</p>

<p>You can still get these puzzles for free from either the Houston Chronicle website, or the Washington Post website for
free. Unfortunately, you will need to do this from a desktop/laptop computer, since their mobile sites do not expose the 
crossword downloads. If you download the puzzles, you can store them in the "crosswords" folder on your phones SD Card and
use them as usual (though the meta information in the menu will not be visible).</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.3.4</h3>

<p>Quick update:
<ul>
	<li>Cleanup unfinished "Never" is fixed. Sorry it took so long to get a fix out for this.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to show the timer and percent complete at the top of the window.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to run the main play screen "Full Screen"</li>
	<li>I also removed download notifications on first run. This seems to freak people out.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once again, if you have any problems feel free to email me. There is still a known issue with slower
phones corrupting puzzles if you exit the app suddenly. I hope to offer some kind of solution to this soon,
but for now, if you hit "Back" and go to the list screen before you leave the app, your puzzle will be 
safe.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.3.0</h3>

<p>I would like to thank Debi Dorman for helping me work through the issues on Droid w/2.1.
Again, there were some crazy issues that were unforseeable and she <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">
emailed me</a> and I was able to work out what the problems were.</p>

<p>Also worth noting that during the last release cycle, Shortyz crossed the 50,000 downloads
milestone, and is now the #1 crossword app in the market by Google's magic sort. Thanks so much
guys. Again, I started this project as most good open source projects start: by scratching my own
itch. It the history of this project, I have gotten one nasty email from a user. You guys are all
great and helpful!</p>

<p>That said, I am starting work on a new Android project, so Shortyz is going to go into hibernation
for a bit. There will be more releases to fix bugs, etc, but I have no plans for major new features
in the near term. All you people who think the app updates to frequently will now be happy. :)
Anyway, look for my second Android app in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>No big new features here but a number of bug fixes:
<ul>
	<li>Main list is rendered before auto-downloads file, preventing that one borked file from
	appearing in the list</li>
	<li>"Archive" changed to "Archives" in browse menu to match plurality with "Crosswords"</li>
	<li>Fixed issue where Froyo on EVO was sending two finish events for multi-touch operations</li>
	<li>Fixed a number of issues with the play timer. It should be reporting correct time now even
	if you exit the app and come back to it</li>
	<li>Changed the behavior of "Cleanup". You can now select a maximum age before unfinish puzzles
	are archived/deleted (including "Never," for those of you who have asked). The deault is 2 days.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Previously: 2.2.17</h3>

<p>Wow, so that last one had some problems. First thing: I would just like to ask everyone:
<br /><br /><b>If you are having problems, <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">email</a> me!</b><br /><br />
I don't own every phone in the world. Really just the one. If there is a problem like this
one, your comments in the Market don't help me fix it at all. If you want to drop your rating
of the app, feel free, but if you want the problem fixed, scroll down and hit that "Developer Email"
button. :P</p>

<p>Next, a bit of explanation: The problem here is that it seems that some phones from Moto and 
Samsung, with certain versions of Android don't include the full set of character encodings
from Java. Specifically, MacRoman (the Mac OS western alphabet), which is used for some of 
the new puzzle sources. This was causing all kinds of havoc. The short version is this:
<ul><li>If you are on some Samsung or Moto phones, you will not see non-English characters
properly on some of the new puzzles</li></ul></p>

<p>They should, however, now work most of the time. Again, I am sorry to anyone who had crash
issues, and I am sorry for spamming everyone else who wasn't with updates. This was just 
something that testing in the emulators wouldn't catch and didn't show up on my phone.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.2.12</h3>

<p>First of all, I would like to officially welcome Jeff Davidson to the "team." He has made a number of big
contributions to this release:

<ul>
   <li>Improved movement semantics, especially when you have skip filled and show errors on.</li>
   <li>New sources, included the first non-AcrossLite format puzzles: Sheffer, Joseph Crosswords, 
   Universal Crossword, USA Today, WaPo Sunday (other days the same as the Houston Chronicle), Newsday,
   Jonesin' Crosswords, Premier Crosswords and the LA Times Sunday Calendar.</li>
   <li>Download dialog now supports selecting a single puzzle source if you want.</li>
   <li>Puzzles with circled clues (that are properly encoded) will show the circles on the playboard.
   Please note: puzzles you have previously downloaded won't work unless you delete and redownload. 
   New puzzles going forward should work fine, though.</li>
   <li>Settings for puzzle sources re-orged.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>Wow. I feel like a wuss now. Thanks so much. In other news...
<ul>
   <li>New rendering code. Mostly you shouldn't notice it, but the Clues display and the Board now share 
   rendering code, so the strange positioning on the Clues display is gone and show errors works propery.</li>
   <li>Pinch zoom for Froyo (Android 2.2) is full on. Will properly center around the pinch, not the 0,0 position. Also the 
   snap from re-rending now more closely matches the sizing of the scaled image. Also limits the scale range
   so you shouldn't be able to hose the app by zooming to large or too small.</li>
   <li>Lots of small bug fixes</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We have also both made a pass at the "Ensure Visible" code. I think it is much improved now but there will be
a few differences. If you nav off the lower edge of the screen, you will snap down the a full screen to the new
cursor position. When you nav off screen into a new word, you will get visibility on the side of the word your
cursor is closest to -- the beginning or end of the word.</p>

<p>From the "You can't please everyone" Department, Double Tap to toggle between default
zoom and fit to screen is back. This time it is a setting that you can toggle. The 
behavior of "Fit to Screen" in the zoom context menu is unchanged.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.2.9</h3>

<p>OK, everyone but me seems to hate the double tap scale. Moved Fit to Screen to the Zoom menu
and works like a standard zoom setting now.</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.2.5</h3>
<p>Doin' the quickie dance:
<ul>
	<li>"Use Native Keyboard" pref replaced with "Keyboard Style". Now includes a keyboard with a row of
	arrow keys. If you are on a device without a ball/dpad (read:EVO, Droid<sup>X</sup>) and aren't 
	using the native keyboard, this will come up by default. Might be good for Droid users too.</li>
	<li>File Corruption on Exit: De-normalized IO code for speed. Hopefully this will help with file corruption issues on 
	slower devices. <b>If this is happening to you, simply "Back" out to the list screen before 
	you switch out of the app!</b></li>
	<li>Double tap the playboard to fast-switch between "Fit to Screen" and whatever your normal
	zoom level is.</li>
	<li>Fixed the "Back" button issue coming back into the play screen from settings/clues</li>
	<li>Icon changed to fit the official 
	<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html">Android 
	style guide</a>: Little smaller, has drop shadow.</li>
	<li>NYT password masked</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.2.0</h3>
<h4>A Brief Note (release info follows):</h4>
<a name="donations" />
<p>Shortyz is free and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shortyz">open source</a>. No ads, no whatever. Honestly, I started working on it because
last fall when I switched from the iPhone world to the Android world, there wasn't an app that
would let me do the NYT puzzle easily on the train ride to work. A number of people have asked about 
a paid version. Honestly, a paid version puts me into copyright issues territory, and I really
don't want to get into that. This is not a business, and I don't want to give the appearance 
I am reselling anyone else's property. I don't host or copy the puzzles you download in the app in any way; you 
download them directly from their publicly available sources with the app.  
</p>
<p>
So, I have added a donate button at the top of this screen. Want to buy me a beer? Feel free, 
but don't feel obligated. You won't get anything more or less out of the app than anyone else.
Also, if you feel like spreading the wealth, consider visiting 
<a href="http://inkwellxwords.com/iwxbooks.html">Ink Well</a> and 
<a href="http://www.brendanemmettquigley.com/">Brendan Emmett Quigley's site</a> and buying their 
fine wares.
</p>
<p>End of speech. At any rate. What is up with this version? Lots of stuff!
<ul>
<li>
I have been watching the new Android Market crash report tool. It only reports for version 
2.1+, I believe. However, I think I have gotten all of the "crash to ground" issues in the app worked out now. 
If you see a complete crash (and not a "Wait"), please <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">email me</a>.
</li>
<li>
Automatic downloads will only be retried once every twelve hours. Yay!
</li>
<li>
Brendan Emmett Quigley's blog scraper is promoted out of experimental. It seems to be working
well.
</li>
<li>
With "Show Errors" on, I now invert the text color on your highlight row, so there is a way to
see incorrect squares without moving the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Some minor changes to the playboard renderer to help with multitouch scaling on Froyo. Not 100% where it
should be, but getting close.
</li>
<li>
The "Search" button, if your device has one, will now skip you to the next clue in the 
same direction as you are currently playing.
</li>
<li>
There is now a confirmation on "Reveal Puzzle."
</li>
<li>
Show Errors and Reveal will be disabled for NYT puzzles that have not updated the answer key.
</li>
<li>
All un-updated NYT puzzles will have their answer key updated on the next download event.
</li>
<li>
NYT Puzzles don't have an answer key have a red progress indicator.
</li>
<li>You also may have noticed in a previous silent version that non-US English characters now
appear (hopefully) correctly in the clues. If you spot a puzzle where they don't, please email me the puzzle
source. This is kind of a guessing game for me, since not all the puzzles seem to be created with
the same characters set.
</li>
<li>There is a new preference option to make the number of characters in a clue appear at the end
of the clue line. This isn't the default because some puzzles include this in the clue, separated
with commas. So "OHGOON" might show as [2,2,2]. I can't synthesize the word breaks (Is that "Oh go on" or "Oh Goon?"), 
but I can show you the total number of characters [6] if you want to see it.
</li>
<li>You can now embiggen the clue text. This is via the "Zoom" context menu (Long touch
the playboard).
</li>
<li>
There are some minor changes to the .shortyz data file format to support future features. 
(I'm working on some cool stuff for Froyo) You shouldn't notice any difference.
</li>
<li>Now waits a moment before showing the busy dialog when rendering the browse view. Some people
have complained about speed, but it hasn't actually changed. I honestly think seeing the busy dialog
just gives that impression. So if I can render the list quickly, I don't show it at all. If this
is actually taking more than a few seconds for you, consider using the "Cleanup" operation to 
move your old and completed puzzles to the archive.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.1.8</h3>
<p>Quick update. Mostly bug fixes. Two noticeable changes:
<ul>
<li>
New look for the puzzle browse screen
</li>
<li>
Show Errors is now persistent.
</li>
<li>
<b>2.1.7 to 2.1.8</b>: Quick fix to make "Show Errors" default to off. 
	This was my mistake.
</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.1.1</h3>

<p>Some updates here most of you won't notice. A few bug fixes. However, if you are running
Froyo (Android 2.2) you now have pinch zoom on the play board and Shortyz will install to external
storage, saving you that whole 100K on your internal storage. :P</p>
<p>There is also a new screen specifically to complain when the SDCard is unavailble. Hopefully
this will reduce support issues for me.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.1.0</h3>

<p>Sorry if you feel spammed the last few days with updates. I am using the holiday to try
and get to all the feature requests and known bugs, so I am pumping them out. This time, though
moving up a whole minor version number!</p>

<p>Lots and Lots of Changes:
<ul>
	<li>New "Movement Style" Preference. You can set this to one of:
	<ul>
	<li>Next word in line (same as previous versions)</li>
	<li>Stop at end (stops at the end of the word rather than move to a new one automatically)</li>
	<li>Next clue in the same direction (moves you to the next across or down clue in order)</li>
	<li>Next parallel clue (moves you to the next clue in the same direction parallel to the word
	from the last box in the word)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Toggle for Spacebar changing directions or wiping a square.</li>
	<li>Toggle for Enter changing directions or moving to next clue (see above ; this doesn't impact 
	the condensed keyboard at all)</li>
	<li>Added the Chronicle of Higher Education puzzle as a source</li>
	<li>Added the Kegler's Kryptics Archive as a scrape (read the help before you enable it)</li>
	<li>The browse view no longer refreshes when you move back to it, improving performance and preserving
	your place in a list</li>
	<li>Some improvement on stray characters on the keyboard swipe</li>
	<li>A number of small bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Special thanks the following people for suggestions/testing for this release (in no particular order):
<ul>
    <li>Brian Christopher</li>
    <li>chemisus</li>
    <li>Alicia Hartman</li>
    <li>Dick Wall</li>
    <li>Brian Gregory</li>
    <li>Katherine Madeira</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.0.30</h3>

<p>Fast update, but this is mostly just bug fixes.
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a crash bug on blank upper left boxes and the clue lie.</li>
 <li>Fixed the chunky scrolling on long clue lists</li>
 <li>For Droid users: You can now make a smooth swipe across the condensed keyboard
     to simulate the DPad when the keyboard is closed.</li>
 <li>Changed the condensed keyboard to be the default. I am satisfied it works well enough.</li>    
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Previously: 2.0.26</h3>

<p>Number of noticeable changes here, mostly just improvements to what is already there. Some 
highlights:
<ul>
	<li>The puzzle list is now grouped and...</li>
	<li>sortable with the new menu item on the browse screen.</li>
	<li>Zoom level on the puzzle now persists as a preference</li>
	<li><b>SWYPE USERS</b> (or anybody): There is now a condensed keyboard available
	within Shortyz. It is smaller than the default Android keyboard so it can be better on
	touch-only phones, and it will get around problems with third party keyboards. You 
	can enable it in the settings by unchecking "Use Native Keyboard".</li>
</ul>

</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.22</h3>

<p>At long, long last the first character bug in the clue list view is fixed. Sorry this took
so long, but that was actually a deep bug based on how the Android list view works.</p>

<p>Cryptics! That's right Brits, there is now a cryptics source available. It is in the 
experimental scrapers section. Please read the help there. It is not enabled by default, so you
will need to go to the settings page.</p>

<p>Number of other small bug fixes that only got one or two reports. Which brings me to</p>

<p>Thanks so much to you guys. The Shortyz user base is great to work with. If you are having 
problems or a suggestion, please email me at <a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com">kebernet@gmail.com</a>
I can't make any promises, but I will do my best to address your issue/feature request.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.17</h3>

<p>This version includes a number of small changes. There has been an upgrade to the playboard
logic, so you should never end up with a focused empty square again.</p>
<p>Next, there is the new "Web Scraping" downloaders. The first of these is from cruciverbalist
and Shortyz user
<a href="http://brendanemmettquigley.com/">Brendan Emmett Quigley</a>. This feature allows for
the inclusion of puzzles that don't come as part of a regular puzzle feed. See the info in the 
"Settings" screen for more information.</p>
<p>The zoom steps on the board have been changed from 50% to 25%</p>
<p>When "Skip Completed Letters" is on, typing over a completed square will not skip the next
completed square. This should make correcting words easier.</p>
<p>Application options have moved to the bottom of the settings screen, after the puzzle sources</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of experimental, if you would like to try a web based version of Shortyz
you can play on your desktop or laptop, try visiting 
<a href="http://shortyz.kebernet.net">http://shortyz.kebernet.net</a>. This version is still 
under heavy development, but is quite playable right now</a>.</p>



<h3>Previously: 2.0.15</h3>

<p>This is mostly work to address bugs that have been reported. If you are experiencing crashes, please

<a href="mailto:kebernet@gmail.com"/>email me</a> your raw log files. This will help me diagnose and 
fix your problems.</p>


<h3>Previously: 2.0.8</h3>
<p>Shortyz has been updated based on some feedback from the user community. Much
of what is new in this version are options for changing the UI behavior under Settings.
 These include:

<ul>
<li>Skill Filled Boxes: Skips over boxes with answers when you enter a new letter.</li>
<li>Scroll To Clue: Scrolls the current clue to the top of the view when in clue mode. This
can make working with the D-Pad/Trackball easier on this screen. (Works like Shortyz 1)</li>
<li>No Download Messages: Prevents a notification from being sent for each new puzzle downloaded.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Other fixes: 
<ul>
<li>"Show Errors" now switches to "Hide Errors" when toggling. </li>
<li>Taping a box in Clues list works, also the scroll position is reset when you move 
from clue to clue, preventing long clues from "breaking" the display.</li>
<li> When "re-downloading" a New York Times puzzle updates the answer key. </li>
<li>Fixed problem of archived puzzles being 
re-downloaded. </li>
<li>Also, work has been done on managing the
on-screen keyboard to make it feel more natural.</li>
</ul>
</p>
